# Getting Started with Open Enclave on Windows for systems with support for SGX1 with Flexible Launch Control(FLC)

## Platform requirements

IntelÂ® X86-64bit architecture with SGX1 and Flexible Launch Control (FLC) support. (e.g. Intel Coffee Lake CPU)

Note: To check if your system has support for SGX1 with FLC, please look [here](../SGXSupportLevel.md)

A version of Windows OS with native support for SGX features:
- For server: Windows Server 2016
- For client: Windows 10 64-bit version 1709 or newer
- To check your Windows version, run `winver` on the command line.

## Install Git and Clone the Open Enclave SDK repo

Download and install Git for Windows from [here](https://git-scm.com/download/win)

Clone the Open Enclave SDK

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/openenclave/openenclave.git
```

This creates a source tree under the directory called openenclave.

## Install project prerequisites

First, change directory into the openenclave repository:

```powershell
cd openenclave
```

Run the following from powershell to deploy all the prerequisites for building Open Enclave(including Intel's DCAP primitives and Azure's DCAP library).

```scripts/install-windows-prereqs.ps1```

```powershell
cd scripts
.\install-windows-prereqs.ps1 -InstallPath YOUR_WORKSPACE_PATH_HERE -LaunchConfiguration SGX1FLC -DCAPClientType Azure
```

As an example, if you cloned the Open Enclave SDK repo into c:\openenclave, you would run the following

```powershell
cd scripts
.\install-windows-prereqs.ps1 -InstallPath C:\openenclave -LaunchConfiguration SGX1FLC -DCAPClientType Azure
```

If you prefer to manually install prerequisites, please refer to this [document](WindowsManualInstallPrereqs.md).

## Build

Launch the [x64 Native Tools Command Prompt for VS 2017](
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/framework/tools/developer-command-prompt-for-vs)
Normally this is accessible under the `Visual Studio 2017` folder in the Start Menu.
To build, first create a build directory ("build" in the example below) and change directory into it.
Then run `cmake` to configure the build and generate the Makefiles, and then build by running `ninja`.

To build debug enclaves
```cmd
cd C:\openenclave
mkdir build\x64-Debug
cd build\x64-Debug
cmake -G Ninja -DBUILD_ENCLAVES=1 -DUSE_LIBSGX=1 ..\..
ninja
```

Similarly, to build release enclaves
```cmd
cd C:\openenclave
mkdir build\x64-Release
cd build\x64-Release
cmake -G Ninja -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_ENCLAVES=1 ../..
ninja
```

## Run unittests

After building, run all unit test cases using `ctest` to confirm the SDK is built and working as expected.

Run the following command from the build directory to run tests(In this exammple, we are testing the debug build):

```cmd
ctest
```

You will see test logs similar to the following:

```cmd
  Test project C:/openenclave/build/x64-Debug
        Start   1: tests/lockless_queue
  1/107 Test   #1: tests/lockless_queue ..................................   Passed    3.49 sec
        Start   2: tests/mem
  2/107 Test   #2: tests/mem .............................................   Passed    0.01 sec
  ...
  ....
100% tests passed, 0 tests failed out of 107
```

A clean pass of the above unit tests run is an indication that your Open Enclave setup was successful. 

You can start playing with the Open Enclave samples after following the instructions in the "Install" section below to configure samples for building,

For more information refer to the [Advanced Test Info](AdvancedTestInfo.md) document.

## Installing the SDK on local machine

To install the SDK on the local machine use the X64 
```cmd
cd build\x64-Debug
ninja install
```
This installs the SDK in c:\opt\openenclave.

## Known Issues

Samples have not yet been ported to Windows.

Not all tests currently run on Windows. See tests\MakeLists.txt for a list of supported tests.
